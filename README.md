# Katas for learning Mac OS X 10.5+ IntelliJ keybindings

These are katas for practicing editing operations.

* Choose a kata you would like to practice, based on it's name
* Collapse the cheat sheet comment at the start of the file
* Scroll through the file and do each exercise as it comes up.
* Undo your changes or git revert after you are complete so that you can do the kata again later
